# PAC Learning of RTAs

> See [PAC Learning of DOTAs](https://github.com/sherwinshen/pac_learn_DOTAs) for a more general and powerful learning tool.

## Overview

This tool is dedicated to learning real-time automata (RTAs), which is a variant of [Lesliea - RTALearning](https://github.com/Leslieaj/RTALearning) based on L* algorithm. This tool for learning RTAs under more realistic assumptions within the framework of PAC learning. Membership queries and equivalence queries are realized via testing. 

## Installation

The project was developed using Python3, and you only need to download the project, but there are a few prerequisites before runningÔºö

- Python3.7.* (or high)
- graphviz (used for drawing)

## Usage

Before executing the program, we need to prepare two files, **model.json** (including model structure) and **precondition.json** (including model information known to learners).

- model.json

```json
{
	"inputs": ["a", "b"],  // input actions
	"states": ["0", "1"],  // state
	"trans": {  // transition setÔºàsource state, input, timeGuards, target stateÔºâ
		"0": ["0", "b", "[0,2)U[3,6)", "0"],
		"1": ["0", "a", "[5,7)", "1"],
		"2": ["1", "b", "[0,7)", "1"]
	},
	"initState": "0",  // initial target
	"acceptStates": ["1"]  // accept state
}
```

- precondition.json

```json
{
  "inputs": ["a", "b"], // ËæìÂÖ•actions
  "upperGuard": 7,  // Êó∂Èó¥‰∏äÁïå
  "sampleNum": 6, // ÈááÊ†∑Êï∞ÔºàÁ¨¶Âè∑ÂåñÂ≠¶‰π†‰ΩøÁî®Ôºâ
  "epsilon": 0.01, // Á≤æÁ°ÆÂ∫¶
  "delta": 0.01 // ÁΩÆ‰ø°Â∫¶
}
```

We provide model examples in `Automata/Model`, and users can also customize the model structure according to file `model.json`. In ` learningrta/main.py ` or ` learningrta_ symbol/main.py `, users can set the target model file path, and run it directly.

- `learningrta/main.py`: a common method of learning RTAs combined with PAC.
- `learningrta_ symbol/main.py`: an advanced method of learning RTAs combined with symbolization method and PAC.
